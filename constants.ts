export const FRENCH_LEARNING_TIPS = [
  "In French, many final consonants are silent! For example, in 'trop' (too much), you don't pronounce the 'p'.",
  "Nouns in French have a gender, either masculine or feminine. This affects the articles (le/la) and adjectives used with them.",
  "Unlike English, adjectives in French usually come *after* the noun they describe. E.g., 'un chat noir' (a cat black).",
  "The French 'R' is pronounced in the back of the throat, different from the English 'R'. Practice it to sound more native!",
  "To make a sentence negative in French, you usually wrap the verb with 'ne' and 'pas'. For example, 'Je sais' (I know) becomes 'Je ne sais pas' (I don't know).",
  "Many English words come from French, but watch out for 'faux amis' (false friends) - words that look similar but have different meanings, like 'librairie' (bookstore) vs. library.",
  "When counting, be aware of the unique structures for 70 (soixante-dix, sixty-ten), 80 (quatre-vingts, four-twenties), and 90 (quatre-vingt-dix, four-twenty-ten).",
  "The pronoun 'on' is very common in spoken French. It can mean 'we', 'they', or 'one' and is often used instead of 'nous' (we) in informal conversation."
